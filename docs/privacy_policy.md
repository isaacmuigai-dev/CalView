# Privacy Policy for CalViewAI

**Last updated: January 08, 2026**

This Privacy Policy describes how CalViewAI ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and shares your personal information when you use our mobile application (the "App").

## 1. Information We Collect

### A. Health Data (via Health Connect)

To provide you with comprehensive health tracking, CalViewAI requests access to data from **Health Connect**. This includes:

- **Steps**: To track your daily activity.
- **Calories Burned**: To estimate your energy expenditure (Active and Total).
- **Exercise**: To log your workouts and their duration.

**We do NOT share your Health Connect data with third parties for advertising purposes.** The use of information received from Health Connect will adhere to the [Health Connect Permissions Policy](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9888170), including the Limited Use requirements.

### B. Device Permissions

- **Camera**: We use your camera solely for the purpose of scanning food items to estimate their nutritional value. We do not store photos or video on our servers; the analysis is performed using AI services and only the nutritional data is retained.
- **Notifications**: We request permission to send you reminders and updates about your health goals.

### C. Usage Data

We use **Firebase Analytics** and **Google Analytics** to collect anonymous usage data. This helps us understand how the App is used and improve its performance. This data may include:

- Device type and operating system.
- App features used and session duration.
- Crash reports.

### D. User Account Information

When you create an account, we store:

- Your name and email address.
- Physical attributes (height, weight, age, gender) to calculate metabolic rates (BMR/BMI).
- Dietary goals and preferences.
  This data is stored securely using **Google Cloud Firestore**.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the collected information for the following purposes:

- **Provide Features**: To calculate your calorie needs, track your progress, and analyze your meals.
- **Improve the App**: To fix bugs and enhance user experience based on analytics.
- **Communication**: To send you notifications (if enabled).

## 3. Data Storage and Retention

- **Local Storage**: Some data is stored locally on your device for offline access.
- **Cloud Storage**: Your user profile and history are synced to Google Cloud Firestore to allow access across devices and prevent data loss.
- **Retention**: We retain your personal data only for as long as necessary to provide you with the App's services. You can request account deletion at any time within the App settings.

## 4. Data Sharing

We do not sell your personal data. We may share data with service providers who assist us in operating the App (e.g., Google Firebase for hosting and analytics), subject to strict confidentiality obligations.

## 5. Security

We take reasonable measures to protect your information, including encryption and secure storage practices. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.

## 6. Your Rights

You may have the right to access, correct, or delete your personal information. You can manage most of your data directly within the App. For account deletion, please use the "Delete Account" option in Settings or contact us.
